# Homework 5: Work Day Scheduler

**Version 1.0**

## Description:

This application allows the user to keep track of tasks as the day goes on and save tasks for later reference.

When looking at the schedule, you can see the hours that have already passed, the current hour, and future hours from 8am to 5pm (the usual working hours each day).

The user can add tasks to each hour and click the save icon to the right of each hour to save the task to local storage.
